# kali-customizer


By using this tool you can improve your welcome terminal interface. This is for linux only. you can install it on termux but it should be rooted.


Installation:


git clone https://github.com/Mr-SimpleEditor/kali-customizer.git


cd kali-customizer


chmod +x script.sh


bash script.sh


After this the tool will install some requirements, the customization process will take 10 - 15 mins if you haven't updated and upgraded your system, so for fast installation first run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get update then run the script. 


Thanks
